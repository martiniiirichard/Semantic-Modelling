1) Model first
  This means decide what fact tables will be made of and what dimension table will be made of. 
  How will these tables be linked?
  What will be the grain?
 What fields do you keep?
 What is the logic for laying out complex calculations?
 Draw.io is an optional tool to help with above.

2) Insights over design
 Tie key KPIS to useful information. Maybe look at threshold comparisons.

3) ETL
  Create Staging queries
  Cleaning queries

4) check for query folding

5) Folders and notes on queries
  Write some notes on fact tables to explain calculations and grain. Notes are seen in power BI

6) Rename Columns to be intuitive

7) Learn to write simple dax
 If you see complex dax cropping up go back to modeling.
 Be explicit in documenting dax for later reminders.

8) Use Model Views

9) Visualizations-design should be surrounding insights not the other way around.
